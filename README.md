# DSA Lab Experiments â€“ S3

This repository contains all my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab experiments for the third semester (S3).

## Contents

- Implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C.
- Source code for lab assignments and experiments.
- Well-documented code for easy understanding and learning.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kashi-techy/S3.git
   ```
2. Browse the folders and files for specific experiments.
3. Compile and run any C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Structure

- Each experiment is in its own C file.
- File names reflect the topic or data structure implemented.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for DSA concepts and practical lab work in S3. It is intended for learning, revision, and sharing with peers.
